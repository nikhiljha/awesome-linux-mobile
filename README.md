# üêßüì± Awesome Linux Mobile [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

An awesome list of Linux Mobile related [apps](#apps), [OS images](#distributions), and [devices](#devices).
Curated to only list beta (or better) projects with a *reasonable amount* of functionality.

## Contents

- [Devices](#devices) - Devices that support Linux.
- [Apps](#apps) - Apps that work well in mobile form factors.
- [Distributions](#distributions) - Distros for your phone.

## Devices

These are devices that have excellent Linux support, either natively or by community support.

### Native

These devices have manufacturers that actively support running Linux on their devices.

- [Pine64 PinePhone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/)
- [Purism Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/)

### Community Support

These devices have a strong Linux community and are well-supported by more than one Linux on Phone project OR are *really* well supported by just one project (all modem functionality, cameras, WiFi and Bluetooth at minimum). <!-- TODO: Make a badge for PostmarketOS and Ubuntu Touch and others to display next to these phone names. -->

- Nexus 5 | [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/PostmarketOS_logo.svg" width=15 height=15> postmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Google_Nexus_5_(lg-hammerhead)) | [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Ubuntu_and_Ubuntu_Server_Icon.png" width=15 height=15> Ubuntu Touch](https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/device/hammerhead/)
- OnePlus One | [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Ubuntu_and_Ubuntu_Server_Icon.png" width=15 height=15> Ubuntu Touch](https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io/device/bacon/)
- A few others, too! Contributions to this list [are welcome](#contribute).

## Apps

These apps work well on Linux phones, and are in a beta stage or better.
- [Authenticator](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Authenticator) - a GTK+ app for two factor authentication/OTP, features a qr-code scanner and file backups
- [Foliate](https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/) - a simple and modern ebook viewer
- More? See the lists below for a non-curated listing of apps.

These are some other lists with Linux Phone apps.
- [Librem's List](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/community-wiki/-/wikis/List-of-Apps-in-Development) - Mostly GTK+ apps that integrate well with their `phosh` mobile desktop shell.
- [Framasoft's List](https://mglapps.frama.io/) - Practically *every* app for mobile GNU/Linux, organized into a table.

## Distributions

These are mobile-specific distributions, or regular distributions that support mobile phones.

- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/PostmarketOS_logo.svg" width=15 height=15> [PostmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) - Based on Alpine Linux, PostmarketOS is a good lightweight pick that still supports a multitude of mobile interfaces.
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Ubuntu_and_Ubuntu_Server_Icon.png" width=15 height=15> [Ubuntu Touch](https://ubuntu-touch.io/) - A community supported continuation of Canonical's project of the same name, Ubuntu Touch runs the unique Unity-based Lomiri interface and has a decently populated app store.
- And more! You can find a pretty good list at the [PinePhone Software Release](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone_Software_Release) page, since nearly every (if not every) Linux-on-phone distribution runs on the PinePhone.

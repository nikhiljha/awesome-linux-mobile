# Definitions

These are the objective criteria to include a device / app / distribution. These aren't strict rules, but
should be used as general guidelines for inclusion.

## Device

### Native

Native devices must ship with an open-source non-Android Linux distribution and without a locked bootloader. 
They must also be supported by at least one non-manufacturer-created distribution.

### Community Support

Community supported devices must **either** be...
- supported by more than one Linux on Phone project
- fully functional, meaning that all of the following works **at minimum**...
  - display + touch screen
  - phone calls
  - SMS
  - mobile data
  - cameras (front and back)

## App

Apps must be released as a BETA piece of software or 1.x+ release, and should not have glaring holes
in functionality or require significant workarounds to use. For example, a podcast app that doesn't
allow you to pause or play your podcast is missing significant functionality. A podcast app that doesn't
support skipping 15s with a single button is okay.

## Distributions

All distributions must support more than one mobile phone.
